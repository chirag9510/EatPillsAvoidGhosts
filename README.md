Eat Pills Avoid Ghosts is a Pacman clone with expanded gameplay features. Stages alternate between the Classic level and a level with randomized enemies and objectives. Everything from Pacman's movement and cornering to each ghost's behaviour and path finding is true to the spirit of the original game with only a slight adjust to the movement speed.
Also I took out the outdated lives system for a more traditional Health Bar, where you get back a small chunk of your health by eating scared ghosts.

Use Visual Studio 2022 to compile under the **Release** and **x64** solution platforms. Or just go to **x64/release** folder to try the compiled exe.
If you wish to adjust the window size, just search for the **WindowSize** float variable and edit the **value** in **assets/maze.json** file.
