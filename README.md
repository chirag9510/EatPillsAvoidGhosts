Eat Pills Avoid Ghosts is a Pacman clone with expanded gameplay features. Stages alternate between the Classic level and a level with randomized enemies and objectives. Just check the bottom text for the current level objective.\
From pacman's movement and cornering to each ghost's behaviour and path finding is true to the spirit of the original game with only a slight adjust to the movement speed and ghosts spawn points.\
Also I took out the outdated lives system for a more traditional Health Bar, where you get back a small chunk of your health by eating scared ghosts.

Use **Visual Studio 2022** to compile under the **Release/x64** solution platforms. Or just go to **x64/release** folder to try the compiled exe.
If you wish to adjust the window size, just search for the **WindowSize** float variable and edit the **value** in **assets/maze.json** file.
